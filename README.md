# Flappy Bird

This is a simple Flappy Bird game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played by clicking the mouse or pressing the `space bar` or `up arrow key` to make the bird jump. The goal is to avoid the pipes and get the highest score possible. The game is over if the bird hits the pipes or the ground or the ceiling.

In the future, I plan to make the bird jump on its own using a simple AI algorithm (with vanilla JavaScript obviously). Stay tuned!
